    <Description>
        Census is a World of Warcraft UI customization which allows you to keep track of your realm's population.  Get a 
        complete breakdown of characters by race, class and level. Census also keeps track of the top guilds 
        on your realm.  Guilds are ranked by the total amount of experience points 
        accumulated by its members.  Clicking on a guild name will give a complete 
        breakdown of the guild by race, class and level.  Mouse over the bars to display a tooltip 
        with the exact number of characters they represent.  You can view compiled data at http://www.warcraftrealms.com
